<!DOCTYPE html>:
indicates that it is a html document file.

<html lang="en">:
specifies the language of the html file
The language code has nothing to do with the characters available to you. It is used for such things as screen reader pronunciation dictionary selection, search engine filtering and automated translation services.

<meta charset="UTF-8">:
Meta charset=“utf-8” is an HTML tag that makes it possible to use emojis and other characters outside of the ASCII character set on your webpage.

Let’s start by breaking the meta charset=“utf-8” tag down:

Meta: This is an HTML tag that contains metadata about a webpage. The search engine uses this to determine the page content and how to treat a webpage.

Charset: This is an attribute that tells your browser what character encoding to use for this webpage to show the content as desired.

UTF-8: This is a version of the character set.

What If You Don’t Use Meta Charset UTF 8?
If you don’t use the tag, then you will have to look up HTML entities like &#xxx; to use that emoji or symbol and get it to display properly.

But it’s highly unlikely that you’re not already using it. !DOCTYPE html, by default, specifies UTF-8 as a character for encoding.

Well, now you might ask why is it written specifically, even after writing ‘DOCTYPE html’?

Many old browsers still don’t support HTML 5 even though it’s become a norm. So, it’s important to include this tag for those browsers.

HTML Block and Inline Elements:
Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is.
The two most common display values are:
1. block
2. inline.

Block-level Elements:
A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.
A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

Here are the block-level elements in HTML:

<address>   <article>   <aside> <blockquote>  <canvas>  <dd>  <div>  <dl>  <dt>   <fieldset>  <figcaption>   <figure>   <footer>  <form>  <h1>-<h6>  <header>  <hr>  <li>  <main>  <nav>   <noscript>   <ol>   <p>  <pre>  <section>  <table>  <tfoot>  <ul>  <video>



Inline Elements:
An inline element does not start on a new line.
An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.

Here are the inline elements in HTML:

<a><abbr><acronym><b><bdo><big><br><button><cite><code><dfn><em><i><img><input><kbd><label><map><object><output><q><samp><script><select><small><span><strong><sub><sup><textarea><time><tt><var>

HTML Favicon:
A favicon is a small image displayed next to the page title in the browser tab.
<link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="images/favicon.ico">
